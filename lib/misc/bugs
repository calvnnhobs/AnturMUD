Text       Ferrycourse room~
Body      In the Ferrycourse Fen between the Derelict Road and Marshy Trail is a room named "undefined". Almost any other word and I would log a typo instead of a bug, but i'm guessing this is appropriate.

Text       curse items~
Body      Can't drop or junk item because it's cursed, but can sell it for a profit.
Possibly ok, since I don't see a way to uncurse without being a high level Cleric.
Aard had a char in the temple you could say 'heal uncurse' to pay to uncurse, unblind, etc.
