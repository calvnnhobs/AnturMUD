* Quests are now available from Vretiel at the Barleywine League's main office, just
  southeast of Market Square. The 'quest' verb is used for all quest-related actions,
  such as list (done in the presence of Vretiel), join, progress, leave, and history.
  More quests will be added as I have time. Eventually, the League storeroom will
  have a shopkeeper to consume your accumulating questpoints. Feedback is welcome.
  One additional note: repeatable quests will not show in your history.
* As of noon today, the current available quests are few and benign, but I'm aiming
  to add more as the weekend progresses!
* Quest completed messages should now appear in Magenta.
* When a mob flees, you can now see which direction (you always could actually,
  EXCEPT when a mob could sneak. But they're not sneaking if they're fleeing!
* The timeout during login has been extended to 60 seconds (though in testing it was
  more like two minutes).
* Shorthand diagonal directions should now work for look and dig. If you find a
  short direction like 'nw' or 'sw' isn't working, let me know.
* Typing 'where' in displays your current area, and will now also show the level
  range for that area.
* Added social SQUINT
