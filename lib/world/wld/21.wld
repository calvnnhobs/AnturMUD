Theme: The road north is now an overgrown swamp.
Plot: The long unused path to Anferry has been retaken by river and sea. The Ferrycourse, as it was called, is now all but gone, and adventurers here may get lost in the tangle and meet creatures unhappy at the intrusion.
Notes: Some rooms will be right outside the north gate of Fasth. The road, although unkempt, will be easy to follow through some light woods north.

Fasth - Outside the Gates~
   The stone gates of Fasth stand prominently to the south, but despite the
proximity to town, the place looks abandoned.  A large wooden sign bearing the
city's crest has been thoroughly defaced, and a few lingering chips of paint
hint at a more polished past.  To the north lies the old Ferrycourse Road,
looking equally empty.  Standing just a few paces from the gates to the west, a
brightly-colored tent billows quietly in the breeze.

Fasth - Ferrycourse Road~
   The old road to Anferry is clearly unused, with shrubs encroaching up close
and weedy flowers growing defiantly in ancient wagon ruts.  Stands of silver
birch clump together to form a wall of sorts to the north, though the forest
does not look uninviting.  To the south are the gates of Fasth.

Fasth - Ferrycourse Road~
   The trees here are thick, making the old road quite distinct, like a hallway
of green.  Despite the denseness, the air is still fresh, and the undergrowth is
dappled with cowslip and heather, forming at times a vibrant carpet.  The path
runs in very nearly a perfectly straight line, indicating some long-expired
craftsmanship.

Fasth - Ferrycourse Road~
   The forest is met quite suddenly by what appears to be a vast marshy area to
the north.  The road is criss-crossed with vines, and a fallen birch tree
further inhibits travel to the northwest, where the Ferrycourse continues deeper
into the marsh.  A much smaller path, nearly obscured by the heather, leads off
to the northeast along the dry boundary between trees and swamp.

with the relatively treeless mire extending beyond sight to the north.  Small
clumps of golden crest seem to appreciate the boundary, and skirt the trail as

Ferrycourse Fen - Beaten Path~
   Gurgling in from the south, a small stream seamlessly melds into the marsh,
becoming one with the endless murky pools and winding waterways that disappear
in the light mist.  Some solid-looking tufts of grass form a reliable ad hoc
trail down into the marsh.  A beaten path continues along the swamp's edge,
skirting the forest as closely as possible.

provides no passage.  Perhaps this trail belongs to wildlife better suited to
crawling through the bracken and beyond.

Ferrycourse Fen - Derelict Road~
   Heavily pockmarked with stagnant puddles, the road is in quite worse shape
than closer to town.  Despite this, the road runs stubbornly straight as an
arrow.  A stone marker, diminished in prominence by weather and wear, notes a
solid path leading southwest, skirting the marsh.

Ferrycourse Fen - Coastal Camp~
   The trail ends here on a muddy beach on the Firth of Fasth.  Waves from the
bay lap calmly on the shore, and a sense of peace pervades.  Rocks from the
beach have been collected and used to build a small ring and firepit, nestled
for protection in the flowering chaparral.  To the north, beyond the fen, runs
the River Prif, and far to the southwest across the bay, tall mountains can
faintly be seen.

Ferrycourse Fen - Derelict Road~
   Sometime long ago, the road was properly shored up by rock and loose gravel,
and graded portions still remain here and there.  However, the fen encompassing
the road is slowly reclaiming its territory, as evidenced by the crumbling
margins and soggy gashes all about.

   Running along the west side of the road are a series of crooked fenceposts,
long since mended and now thoroughly askew.  Between two such posts runs a
narrow lane that gradually becomes submerged by brackish water.  The Ferrycourse
continues straight and sad to the northwest and southeast.

   Disappearing beneath a deepening layer of muck, the lane from the east
disappears into standing water.  What might have once been farmland is now
overcome by brown grasses, broad lily pads and the occasional tree stump.  A
somewhat drier way can be made out southwards, while off to the west, a long
hill can be seen.

   Woven straw and reeds mark the collapsed thatch roof of a homestead, standing
drear and unaccessible.  Tangled vines continue their work on the wreckage,
pulling apart stones with the slow creep of time.  A well also stands nearby,
now quite unnecessary for the parched patrons of the land.

Ferrycourse Fen - Marshland~
   The land here is risen a bit above the surrounding swamp, and the grasses
have given way briefly to dry, hard ground.  The welcome respite is used to
wring out wet clothing, taking great care to remove the slime that slowly
accumulates during a tromp through the fens.  A trail marked by green stones
leads down from here, while the other available directions are all back into the
mire.

Ferrycourse Fen - Collapsed Dock~
   The trail leads out of thick brush to a rotting dock, missing half the planks
and looking not at all safe for even a trial.  Just to the side of the dock, a
half-submerged boat is now covered in moss and also not looking the part.  Tall
reeds prevent seeing far beyond the dock into the waterway, but the saltwater
means it leads eventually out to sea.

notably missing.  For just a brief second, the swamp seems bearable.

simple farmhouse stands east for the most part intact, albeit smothered in
creepers, and nearby what appears to be some stables looks more like a skeleton
of wood.  North of the farmhouse, an old dike stands relatively high above the
fen that otherwise surrounds these remnants of civilization.

   A few feet of cold, dark sludge fill the farmhouse, and in the water lie

down mattress in the corner looks made and ready.  Everything points towards a
sudden exit by the previous tenants.

   What remains of the levee is most solid along this stretch, aside from a few
narrow points and one especially large rent that requires jumping over.  The
view is broad but dreary, as the rotting wasteland fully encompasses the raised
bar of land.  Here and there, evidence points towards this area having been
inhabited - perhaps the word Ferrycourse wasn't always a byword for wasteland.

   Either by design or by mistake, the trail ends on banks beside a deep arm of
